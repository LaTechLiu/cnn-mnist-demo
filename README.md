# cnn-mnist-demo
Minimal PyTorch code showcasing CNNs applied to MNIST classification.

A simple **Jupyter Notebook demonstration** of training a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** on the **MNIST handwritten digits dataset**.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Notebook-based workflow for easy experimentation  
- Implementation of a basic CNN for digit recognition  
- Training on MNIST (60,000 training + 10,000 testing images)  
- Evaluation with accuracy metrics and visualization of predictions  
- Pre-trained model (`cnn.pth`) included â€” skip training and go directly to inference  

---
## ðŸš€ How to Use
Simply open the notebook in Google Colab and run all cells:

- **Option 1:** Train the CNN from scratch (default flow in the notebook).  
- **Option 2:** Load the provided `cnn.pth` file to skip training and directly test the model.
